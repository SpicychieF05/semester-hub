# Database Setup Instructions with Real-Time Auto-Sync

## Issue
The "Error adding subject: Unknown error occurred" happens because the required database tables (departments, subjects, semesters) might not exist in your Supabase database.

## Enhanced Solution
This setup now includes **automatic real-time synchronization** - any changes made by users or admins will be instantly reflected across all connected clients without requiring page refresh.

## New Features Added:
✅ **Real-time data synchronization** across all admin and user interfaces  
✅ **Automatic activity logging** for all admin actions  
✅ **Enhanced error handling** with detailed console logging  
✅ **Optimized CRUD operations** using centralized SupabaseService  
✅ **Auto-refresh UI** when data changes occur  
✅ **Comprehensive database schema** with all necessary tables

## Solution
Follow these steps to set up the database:

### Step 1: Run SQL Script in Supabase

**Option A: Safe Version (Recommended)**
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `setup-database-safe.sql` 
4. Click "Run" to execute the script (no warnings should appear)

**Option B: Original Version**
1. If you see a "destructive operation" warning when using the original `setup-database.sql`
2. You can safely click "Run this query" - the warning appears because of policy management
3. The script uses `IF NOT EXISTS` and `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to prevent data loss

### Step 2: Verify Tables
After running the script, you should see these tables created:
- **departments** table with 6 default departments
- **subjects** table (empty initially) 
- **semesters** table with 8 default semesters
- **admin_actions** table for activity logging
- **notes** table for note sharing
- **users** table for user management

### Step 3: Test Real-Time Auto-Sync
1. Go to Admin Dashboard
2. Navigate to Content Management > Subjects
3. Try adding a new subject - it should appear instantly
4. Open the same page in another browser tab - changes will sync automatically
5. Check browser console (F12) for real-time update logs

## Enhanced Features Now Active
The application now includes:
- **Real-time data synchronization** - All changes sync instantly across clients
- **Automatic activity logging** - All admin actions are logged with detailed audit trail
- **Enhanced error handling** - Better error messages with specific Supabase error details
- **Optimized performance** - Uses centralized SupabaseService for all database operations
- **Auto-refresh UI** - No need to manually refresh pages when data changes
- **Comprehensive database schema** - All necessary tables with proper relationships

## Real-Time Features:
1. **Admin Dashboard**: All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) sync instantly
2. **Note Management**: Approve/reject/delete actions appear immediately
3. **User Management**: Ban/unban status updates in real-time
4. **Browse Notes**: New approved notes appear automatically for users
5. **Activity Logging**: All admin actions tracked with timestamps and details

## How Auto-Sync Works:
- Uses Supabase real-time subscriptions for live data updates
- Eliminates need for manual page refreshes
- Provides instant feedback for all user actions
- Maintains data consistency across multiple admin sessions

## Troubleshooting
If you still get errors:
1. Check browser console (F12) for detailed error messages
2. Verify Supabase connection in the browser network tab
3. Check Row Level Security policies in Supabase dashboard
4. Ensure your Supabase API key has proper permissions

## Quick Fix
If the automated setup doesn't work, manually run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Just create the basic tables
CREATE TABLE departments (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, code TEXT UNIQUE, description TEXT);
CREATE TABLE subjects (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, code TEXT, description TEXT, department_id INTEGER REFERENCES departments(id));
CREATE TABLE semesters (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, number INTEGER UNIQUE, name TEXT, is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true);

-- Insert one test department
INSERT INTO departments (name, code, description) VALUES ('Computer Science', 'CS', 'Test Department');
```
